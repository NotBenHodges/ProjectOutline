    <h1>Ben and Daniel's CSS Project Design!</h1>
    <p>The goal of our project was to create a classical music<br>
    themed webpage that incorporates interactive piano keys.<br>
    To do this, we incorporated a hover effect on the piano keys<br>
    so that when the cursor moves over them, it appears that the<br>
    piano is being played. We also floated the grading and day<br>
    boxes so that the black keys would appear in between the white<br>
    ones, just like a real piano. We also included some colors that<br>
      we thought were appropriate for the theme, such as a dark brown<br>
      background and gray so that text is easier to read.<br>
