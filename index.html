    <h1>Ben and Daniel's CSS Project Design!</h1>
    <p>The goal of our project was to create a classical music</p>
    <p>themed webpage that incorporates interactive piano keys.</p>
    <p>To do this, we incorporated a hover effect on the piano keys</p>
    <p>so that when the cursor moves over them, it appears that the</p>
    <p>piano is being played. We also floated the grading and day</p>
    <p>boxes so that the black keys would appear in between the white</p>
    <p>ones, just like a real piano.</p>
